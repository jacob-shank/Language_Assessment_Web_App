- The zipped folder, IWC-main.zip contains all the code for the application so far
- In IWC-main.zip, there is a VERY important ReadMe. Read that file. It explains the entire project, including installation and running
- There is an Installation Guide in this repo as well
  - You may also find that you have class with Nathan or Will (or they may even be in your group!), if this is the case, feel free to ask them for access to the necessary team accounts
- The other zipped folder (sprint presentations), contains all the presentations from the semester as a resource (we suspect that the weekly status reports included in the FinalReport.docx will be more helpful but we have included these as well)
